### Visual Design

---

- Colour Scheme
    - Green
    - Black
    - White/grey
    
    ---
    
    I selected these colours for the website as I felt it matched the content of the website quite well. Black and White is a suitable colour for the theme of history, and green not only represents a "family tree", it is also representative of Ireland and the counties the services are offered in. Many customers of Irish genealogy services Idolise Traditional Irish history and will be drawn to the green colors.
    
    ---
    
- Typography
    - 'Oswald', sans-serif
    - 'Lato', sans-serif
    
    ---
    
    I chose these fonts as I thought they had a formal feeling to match the analytical and academic nature of the content.
    
- Images
